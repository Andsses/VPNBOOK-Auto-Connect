## VPNBOOK Auto-Connect

A tool that allows you to choose a VPN from the official VPNBook website, download and unzip it, and retrieve the username and password for the VPN. Since VPNBook periodically changes the credentials, this script automates the process of fetching the current credentials. After obtaining the credentials, you can use a Bash script to automatically connect to the VPN with the appropriate credentials. The tool also allows you to select which VPN to connect to.
